# TerminalPokeDex
### A terminal-based PokeDex written in C#! This was designed to provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime, and manga series
 
#### Features
- Choose a Pokemon that you would like to learn more about and the console will give you information on it.
- Displays evolutions if the Pokemon has any!
- Shows the various special forms that a Pokemon may have.
- Prompts the user to with options to help narrow-down their search for a desired Pokemon.
- Outputs each Pokedex entry in a readable way and hides unnecessary or blank information.
- Choose whether or not you want a colorful console in the settings.
- Pick whether or not you want the data returned in metric measurements to imperial measurements.

 
#### Code Louisville Project Requirements
- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app (PokeAPI).
- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands / perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- Created and used a function that accepts mulitple parameters, calculates a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value.
- Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure(such as a list or array) or file.
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- Built a conversion setting that converts output data from metric measurements to imperial measurements if the user chooses to utilize it.
